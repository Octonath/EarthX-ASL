# EarthX-ASL

This is an Autosplitter that i've wrote for the game EarthX with the help of Ero

# What can it do ?

It can do splits for :

- When you unlock the Small rocket
- When you unlock the Medium rocket
- When you unlock the Cargo capsule
- When you unlock the Large rocket
- When you unlock the Cargo spaceship
- When you unlock the Moonship
- When you land on The Moon
- When you land on Mars
- When you unlock the Crew spaceship
- When you have Mars terraformed

# Settings

Yes, settings. It has settings for every splits so that you can customize it how you want.

But also the important thing is that you can set it up for the Crew% speedrun by disabling spliting when you have Mars terraformed and enabling when you have Crew on Mars !

# Contributing

This autosplitter is my first one so there are plenty more improvements to do. Those improvements can come from you.

There is also somes variables that aren't used, you can add them to the split by adding the parameter in `startup` just like that :

```cake
settings.Add("VariableName", true, "Split when Something");
```
